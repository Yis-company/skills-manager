## Features

Agents Manager brings three kinds of reusable resources into one Library: Skills, Instructions, and MCP definitions. The same host selector scopes the Library and Global and Project Workspaces; a remote host keeps its own files and library. See [Agents Manager workflows and CLI](AGENTS-MANAGER.md) for deployment reviews, credential references, recovery, and backup compatibility.

- **Unified skill library** — Install skills from Git repos, local folders, `.zip` / `.skill` archives, or the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) marketplace. Everything goes into one central repo, which defaults to `~/.skills-manager` and can be customized in **Settings**.
- **Instructions** — Edit supported instruction files in place or save reusable bundles with linked documents. Review deployments against the current project before applying them; library edits never silently change deployed files.
- **MCP connections** — Add definitions manually, import supported configurations, or browse the official MCP Registry. Review commands, arguments, and credential references before saving or deploying. The target agent handles process startup and authentication.
- **Marketplace** — Browse popular skills from the marketplace and find them with keyword search.
- **Your agents can manage skills** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and the rest can install a skill, deploy it to another agent, or report what is where, by driving Agents Manager instead of writing into an agent's folder behind its back — so sources, presets, update tracking and per-agent state stay intact. The Dashboard sets this up in one click; see [Let your agents manage skills](#let-your-agents-manage-skills).
- **Presets** — Group skills into named presets. In any workspace, click a preset pill to instantly activate or deactivate all its skills for the current agent scope. Applying a preset is a one-time copy, not a live sync. The sidebar lists all presets for quick access.
- **Global Workspace** — Each agent gets its own page listing every skill in its global folder — including ones installed outside Agents Manager — so the view always reflects what the agent actually sees. Add or remove skills per agent, or use the All Agents overview to manage every installed agent at once.
- **Project Workspaces** — View and manage project-local skill folders for supported agents, compare them with your central library, and sync changes in either direction. Supports nested skill directories and per-agent assignment when exporting.
- **SSH hosts** — Register remote macOS or Linux hosts in Settings, connect using your existing SSH access, and manage their own library and project paths from the host selector.
- **Linked Workspaces** — Point to any directory as a skills root — useful for skills that live outside the default agent paths. Managed as a standalone workspace without participating in global preset sync.
- **Multi-tool sync** — Sync skills to any supported tool via symlink or copy with a single click. Every skill card shows an agent icon badge per enabled agent — click a badge to install or remove that skill for that agent right from the card, with the badge reflecting live sync state.
- **Add from Library sheet** — In any workspace, click **+ Add Skills** to open a unified picker: search your central library, toggle target agents with always-visible chips (with select-all/clear), and batch-add multiple skills in one click.
- **Batch operations** — Multi-select skills for bulk enable/disable, export, or delete. Project Workspaces also support bulk enable/disable for project-local skills.
- **Skill tagging and filters** — Tag skills, use tags to group similar skills, and filter by source or tag — including an **Untagged** pill to quickly find skills missing labels.
- **Update tracking** — Check for upstream updates on Git-based skills; re-import local ones.
- **Skill preview and source inspection** — Read `SKILL.md` / `README.md`, inspect source metadata, and compare local content with the upstream version inside the app.
- **Custom tools** — Add your own agents/tools with custom skills directories, or override the default path for any built-in tool.
- **Backup & multi-device sync** — Back up the library, including portable Instructions and MCP definitions, to a Git repository. Skill changes merge by skill; conflicting Instructions or MCP definitions pause the merge for review. Backups and their controls are local to the machine, even when a remote host is selected. Deployment state, overrides, journals, catalog caches, and secrets are excluded. See [backup compatibility](AGENTS-MANAGER.md#backup-compatibility).
- **Activity log & Export Logs** — Install / remove / update / sync operations are recorded locally. Use **Settings → Export Logs** to bundle recent logs and activity history into a single zip for easier issue reports.
- **Flexible app settings** — Configure repo path, sync mode, theme, text size, language, tray behavior, proxy, Git remote, update checks, and the order agents appear throughout the app — all in one place.
- **In-app updates** — The app tells you when a new version is out and installs it for you on macOS and Windows. Nothing downloads or installs on its own: checking only notifies, and installing and restarting each take a click.

## Install

### macOS

Download the `.dmg` for your Mac from the [latest release](https://github.com/Yis-company/skills-manager/releases/latest).

Releases aren't notarized by Apple yet, so the first time you open the app macOS says it "is damaged and can't be opened". After dragging it to Applications, run this once:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/skills-manager.app
```

Updates installed from inside the app don't need this.

### Windows and Linux

Download the installer for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/Yis-company/skills-manager/releases/latest): `.exe` or `.msi` for Windows, and `.AppImage`, `.deb`, or `.rpm` for Linux (x64 and arm64).

Every installer ships the CLI inside the app — see [Where the binary lives](#where-the-binary-lives).

## Quick Start

1. Add Skills from local folders, Git repositories, archives, or the marketplace; create or import Instructions and MCP definitions in the Library.
2. Choose a local or registered SSH host, then open Global Workspace or a Project Workspace and select the agent and resources to deploy.
3. Review instruction and MCP deployment previews before applying them. Use presets or **+ Add Skills** to manage skills in a workspace.
4. Set up Git backup for the local library from **Backup** or **Settings** when you want history or multi-device sync.

## Let your agents manage skills

Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and the rest can install a skill, deploy it to another agent, or report what is where — by driving Agents Manager rather than writing into an agent's folder behind its back. That is what keeps source metadata, preset membership, update tracking and cross-agent deployment state intact.

The Dashboard offers a one-time setup: pick the agents that should be able to do it, and the app installs the [`manage-skills`](skills/manage-skills/SKILL.md) skill and deploys it to exactly those. Afterwards it is an ordinary library skill — adding or removing an agent is the agent badge row on its own card. No PATH setup is involved: the app publishes a copy of its CLI where agents look for it.

It is also published as a skill, so it can be installed without the app:

```bash
npx skills add Yis-company/skills-manager
```

## Backup & Multi-Device Sync

The **Backup** page (sidebar) keeps your skill library versioned in a Git repository. One device gets versioned backup with restorable snapshots; several devices connected to the same repository stay in sync with each other automatically. The remote stays a plain Git repository — you can `git clone` it anywhere, no lock-in.

### Connect

- **Sign in with GitHub** (recommended): an 8-digit device-flow sign-in creates a private `skills-manager-backup` repository for you. The token is stored in the OS keychain — never in files or the repo config.
- **Advanced**: paste any Git URL (HTTPS + PAT, SSH, self-hosted) under **Settings → Git Sync Configuration**.
- On a new machine with an empty library, the first launch asks: **start fresh, or restore from a backup?**

### How syncing works

- **Automatic**: local changes are committed and pushed in the background a couple of minutes after you stop editing; updates pushed by your other devices are merged in and pushed back automatically. **Back Up Now** is always available for an immediate run, and every backup in the history shows which device made it.
- **Skill-aware merging**: changes are merged per skill, not per text line — renaming a skill on one machine combines cleanly with editing its content on another.
- **Skill conflicts**: if the same skill was edited on two devices at once, review the conflict and choose **keep mine / use remote / keep both**. A safety snapshot is taken before a choice is applied.
- **Instruction and MCP conflicts**: a conflicting bundle or definition pauses the merge. Choose which version to keep in the Library, then run sync again.
- **Snapshots & restore**: manual backups create snapshot versions; open the Backup page history to restore any of them. A restore first saves the current state as its own snapshot.

### What's included

Skills, tags, presets, per-agent skill toggles, portable instruction bundles, and MCP definitions are backed up. Deployment state, overrides, journals, catalog caches, and secrets stay local. Backups are controlled by the local machine even while an SSH host is selected. Skills over 100 MB stay local and are excluded from backup automatically (labeled on the Backup page). The SQLite database is not in Git — it stores metadata that is rebuilt from the skill files.

### Disconnecting

The Backup page offers three levels: **disconnect this machine** (other devices and remote data untouched), **revoke the GitHub authorization**, or **delete the remote backup** entirely (routed through GitHub's own type-the-name confirmation).

## Supported Tools

Skill management supports 54 agents out of the box, including:

Claude Code · Codex · Cursor · GitHub Copilot · Gemini CLI · GitLab Duo · OpenCode · OpenClaw · Hermes Agent · OpenHands · Cline · Goose · Windsurf · Continue · Grok · Antigravity · Qwen Code · ZCode · Crush · Kilo Code · Roo Code · Amp · Kiro CLI · Droid · TRAE IDE · Warp · Qoder · CodeBuddy

**Settings** lists them all, leading with the ones detected on your machine. You can also add custom tools there and manage their skills the same way.

Instruction and MCP support varies by agent and scope; see the [capability boundaries](AGENTS-MANAGER.md#mcp-connections).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Desktop | Tauri 2 |
| Backend | Rust |
| Storage | SQLite (`rusqlite`) |
| i18n | react-i18next |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (required by Vite 7)
- pnpm (run `corepack enable` to use the version pinned in `package.json`)
- Rust 1.77.2 or newer
- [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS

### Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev
```

### CLI

The repository includes an agent-friendly CLI built on the same Rust shared core used by the desktop app. Both the CLI and the desktop app go through the same SQLite database, central library, and sync engine.

```bash
# Look around
pnpm cli skills list
pnpm cli skills show db

# Install into the library (does NOT deploy to any agent by itself)
pnpm cli skills install ./my-skill
pnpm cli skills install https://github.com/foo/bar/tree/main/skills/baz
pnpm cli skills install vercel-labs/agent-skills@react-best-practices

# Put it into the agents that should have it, then check
pnpm cli skills deploy react-best-practices --agent claude_code --agent codex
pnpm cli skills status react-best-practices

# Pull upstream changes, and adopt what an agent already has
pnpm cli skills check --all
pnpm cli skills update --all
pnpm cli skills adopt ~/.claude/skills --dry-run
```

`--help` on any group or subcommand prints the full surface — the groups below
each carry more than these examples show. `--dry-run` is available on selected
commands, including `skills deploy/undeploy/sync/remove/adopt` and
`presets deploy/undeploy/delete`; check each subcommand's help before using it.
`skills remove` requires `--yes` for actual deletion.

Available command groups:
- `repo` — inspect or change the configured base directory
- `agents` (`tools` alias) — list agents, globally enable or disable them, and add custom agents (`add-custom`)
- `skills` — manage the central library and real per-agent deployments (`deploy / undeploy / status`)
- `instructions` — save, inspect, scan, preview, apply, and recover instruction bundles
- `mcps` — inspect capabilities, manage definitions, preview deployments, and recover operations
- `presets` — create, update, delete, organize, deploy, undeploy, and inspect presets
- `git` — operate on the git-backed `skills/` repository (`clone`, `pull`, `push`, `commit`, `versions`, `restore`)

Extra flags:
- `--skills-root <path>` — operate on a cloned/exported skills repo directly instead of the local app default. The manager's state (DB, presets, cache, logs) lives in `~/.skills-manager/external/<name>-<hash>/`, namespaced by the canonical path of the skills root, so the external checkout itself stays clean.
- `--json` — machine-readable output for scripts/agents. Failures print `{"ok": false, "code": …, "message": …}` on stderr with a non-zero exit. A deployment refused because the target is not ours carries the paths as data (`code: "TARGET_CONFLICT"`, `details.conflicts[].path`) so a caller can name the directory in the way instead of quoting a sentence.

```bash
pnpm --silent cli --skills-root /path/to/my-skills --json skills list
```

#### Agents inside WSL

The Windows app cannot create links inside WSL, so it can only copy skills there. If your agents live in WSL, run the Linux CLI inside WSL instead — it keeps its own library there and deploys with real symlinks:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && curl -L -o ~/.local/bin/skills-manager-cli \
  https://github.com/Yis-company/skills-manager/releases/latest/download/skills-manager-cli-Linux-x64
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/skills-manager-cli
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
skills-manager-cli agents add-custom hermes-work --path ~/.hermes/profiles/work/skills
skills-manager-cli skills install ./my-skill
skills-manager-cli skills deploy my-skill --agent hermes-work
```

#### Where the binary lives

At startup the app publishes a copy of its own CLI to `~/.skills-manager/bin/skills-manager-cli`, always matching the running app, so agents can find it without anything on your PATH. A `.version` stamp beside it is written only after the copy is verified and removed before each republish, so a copy that failed — a binary held open on Windows, say — is never presented as usable.

Putting the CLI on your *own* PATH, for typing commands yourself, is separate:

```bash
pnpm cli:install
# equivalent to:
# cargo install --path src-tauri --bin skills-manager-cli --locked --force
```

This drops the binary at `~/.cargo/bin/skills-manager-cli`. Re-run after pulling updates to refresh it.

Official releases also publish standalone CLI binaries for macOS arm64/x64, Windows x64, and Linux x64. Download the matching `skills-manager-cli-*` asset, make it executable on macOS/Linux, and place it on PATH.

#### Concurrent use with the desktop app

The CLI and desktop app share the same SQLite database and repository lock. The app's filesystem watcher normally refreshes after CLI metadata or deployment changes. If the app was suspended while a command ran, trigger one manual refresh.

#### Updating a remote connection

Remote connections require the CLI version to match the local desktop app. When a connection reports a different version, choose **Review update**, or use the update action after checking the host in Settings. Review the host and versions, then install the matching version and reconnect.

The app downloads the matching macOS or Linux CLI from `Yis-company/skills-manager`, transfers it using your existing SSH access, and selects a separate versioned CLI for that connection. It keeps the remote desktop app, its published CLI, and your skill library in place. No remote internet access or `sudo` is needed. An unpublished version or unsupported platform produces an error without changing the selected CLI.

Desktop update checks and installation also use `Yis-company/skills-manager`. Editing a checkout does not change an already installed app.

### Build

```bash
pnpm tauri:build
pnpm cli:build
```

### Changesets and releases

Every PR that changes the app (`src/`, `src-tauri/`, `skills/` and similar) needs a changeset, which the **Changeset** check enforces:

```bash
pnpm changeset          # pick patch/minor/major and describe the change
pnpm changeset --empty  # an app change that doesn't need a changelog entry
```

Changes to docs and CI don't need one.

Once changesets land on `main`, the **Version** workflow opens a `chore: version packages` PR. That PR bumps every version file and writes `CHANGELOG.md`. Merging it tags `vX.Y.Z` and starts the **Build & Release** workflow. Merging the version PR is the only way to cut a release. Don't push `v*` tags by hand.

If the release build fails after the tag exists, merging again won't retry it, because the Version workflow won't release a tag twice. Once the cause is fixed, do one of these:

- Re-run the failed jobs from the Actions tab. They build the same tagged commit.
- If the fix is in the workflow or in repo secrets, start a new run on the tag:

  ```bash
  gh workflow run release.yml --ref vX.Y.Z
  ```

  If it then fails on assets already attached to the draft release, delete that draft and run it again.

If the fix needs a code change, merge it with a changeset and release the next version instead. A tag always stays on the commit it was cut from.
